# Project: RESTaurant

A template that I had hoped would aid me in constructing a web shop for specifically customers in the food industry in promoting
their goods. I had chosen this as there was a request from a family member in producing a web shop however due to the request itself
being too vague, I will be using a series of random menus to simply display the functionality of the app.

## General Information

As mentioned above, the project will be a template for me to work on. It will be a project I expect to use in my portfolio when displaying my abilities. It will be constructed in a modular fashion as to allow it to be easily modified to different customers however unique enough that it will allow personalisation efficient and straight forward.

### Timeline
_10/12/2017_
- Establish a clear objective as well as essential and optional features
Look into webpack and if it is able to launch both react and node with ease.
(Depending on my understanding, I will decide whether to construct the app with
NodeJS/jQuery/Express/Sequelize or NodeJS/ReactJS/Express/Sequelize)

_11/12/2017_
- Setting up the basic structure
    - Server routes
    - Database models
    - Database functions
    - Pug pages

_12/12/2017_
- Read up and incorporate the shopping cart as well as the paypal API.

_13/12/2017_
- Add the extended functionalities if all else is completed as well as jQuery for front-end

_14/12/2017 - 15/12/2017_
- CSS
- Finishing touches

### Technical Specifications:

- Display different items under different categories
- Add items to the cart as well as making the purchase
- Placing the order, which will return an alert from the admin side(Or send the order to the an email address)

### Complications

- I would like to incorporate a sophisticated filter functionality, similar to that of pinterest.
    -   A main filter and then with each added filter a narrowed down list will be passed down that will be displayed.
- If possible, I would like to extend its functionalities if there is time.
    - Login
    - Users will have feedback privileges
    - Admins may remove or add items to the menu
    - What data will you need to store? How will it be organised? Describe each table, its columns, and its relationships with other tables.
- Id = 1, will be assumed as admin and will have access to editing everything in the database with the option of granting moderator privileges to allow a more independent take on editing the menu.
